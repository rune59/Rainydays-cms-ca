# How To Use
The website uses Woo Commerce as a headless CMS.

JavaScript is used to extract text and images from Woo Commerce and present these on the website.

The user of the program only needs to relate to the menu on the black bar at the top of each screen. 

The menu bar is self-explanatory for where in the program you are.
The menus are
- Home
- About
- Products
- Contact
